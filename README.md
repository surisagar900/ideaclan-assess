# Problem Statement

**Create a mini app with below requirements:**

·       A form along with a table. You can use any UI library of your choice to make it visually appealing

·       The form should have 7-8 different kinds of input fields like text field, select, radio button, which the user can fill.

·       There should be validation handled for any single text field, select, and radio button (for all element types)

·       Once the user clicks on Submit, the entered data in the form should be reflected on the table.

·       You also have to implement manual sort and search (not from the UI library)

·       The table should have a summary field as the last row which has calculations of all numeric fields.

·       Implement update, delete and copy rows on the table.

·       For initial render, the table should load some predefined data from any JSON, which could be edited/deleted

·       Implementation of pagination, use Memo and use Call-back will earn you brownie points.
